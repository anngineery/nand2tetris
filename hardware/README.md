# How the final computer was tested
One way to ensure that the Hack computer (Computer.hdl) is working correctly is by running Hack machine code and checking the results.
The following screen recordings show my Hack computer running test scripts on the Hardware Simulator tool provided by the course.

## Test 1: Store the result of 2 + 3 in RAM[0]

## Test 2: Store max(RAM[0], RAM[1]) in RAM[2]
It runs twice with 2 different sets of numbers.\
